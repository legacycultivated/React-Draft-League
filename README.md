# Pokemon Draft League React Application

## Overview

To create an application where users can enter how many teams will participate, creating said number of teams, allowing users to delete and add teams as needed, and allowing users to select pokemon to add to these teams.

### Technology

This project was built using React.js and the Create-React-App. This project is educational at its core to practice using React and its features such as useState and props. Though it is a simple application the unidirectional flow of React.js and its data/code from parent to child can be seen in the way team cards are generated when selecting the amount of teams.

### Conclusion

My friends and I enjoyed building this project from scratch with nothing but our ideas and creativity. Even though we are all juniors and not at all experts in design we were excited to bring our thoughts to life. This is the second run through of this particular project. We first wrote this project in plain javascript then re-created in React to practice and learn.
